<h1><u>Advantages of Robotics</h1></u>
<p>Many people fear that robots or full automation may someday take their jobs, but this is simply not the case. Robots bring more advantages than disadvantages to the workplace. They enrich a company’s ability to succeed while improving the lives of real, human employees who are still needed to keep operations running smoothly. If you’re thinking about investing in some robots, share the advantages with your employees. You might be surprised at how many of them are quick to support the idea.<p>

<h3>What are the advantages of bringing robots into society?</h3>

    <h3>Safety</h3><p>Safety is the most obvious advantage of utilizing robotics. Heavy machinery, machinery that runs at hot temperature, and sharp objects can easily injure a human being. By delegating dangerous tasks to a robot, you’re more likely to look at a repair bill than a serious medical bill or a lawsuit. Employees who work dangerous jobs will be thankful that robots can remove some of the risks.<p>
        <h3>Speed</h3><p>Robots don’t get distracted or need to take breaks. They don’t request vacation time or ask to leave an hour early. A robot will never feel stressed out and start running slower. They also don’t need to be invited to employee meetings or training session. Robots can work all the time, and this speeds up production. They keep your employees from having to overwork themselves to meet high pressure deadlines or seemingly impossible standards.</p>
        <h3>Consistency</h3><p>Robots never need to divide their attention between a multitude of things. Their work is never contingent on the work of other people. They won’t have unexpected emergencies, and they won’t need to be relocated to complete a different time sensitive task. They’re always there, and they’re doing what they’re supposed to do. Automation is typically far more reliable than human labor.</p>
        <h3>Perfection</h3><p>Robots will always deliver quality. Since they’re programmed for precise, repetitive motion, they’re less likely to make mistakes. In some ways, robots are simultaneously an employee and a quality control system. A lack of quirks and preferences, combined with the eliminated possibility of human error, will create a predictably perfect product every time.</p>
        <h3>Happier Employees</h3><p>Since robots are often assigned to perform tasks that people don’t particularly enjoy, like menial work, repetitive motion, or dangerous jobs, your employees are more likely to be happy. They’ll be focusing on more engaging work that’s less likely to grind down their nerves. They might want to take advantage of additional educational opportunities, utilize your employee wellness program, or participate in an innovative workplace project. They’ll be happy to let the robots do the work that leaves them feeling burned out.</p>
        <h3>Job Creation</h3>Robots don’t take jobs away. They merely change the jobs that exist. Robots need people for monitoring and supervision. The more robots we need, the more people we’ll need to build those robots. By training your employees to work with robots, you’re giving them a reason to stay motivated in their position with your company. They’ll be there for the advancements and they’ll have the unique opportunity to develop a new set of tech or engineering related skills.</p>
        <h3>Productivity</h3><p>Robots can’t do everything. Some jobs absolutely need to be completed by a human. If your human employees aren’t caught up doing the things that could have easily be left for robots, they’ll be available and productive. They can talk to customers, answer emails and social media comments, help with branding and marketing, and sell products. You’ll be amazed at how much they can accomplish when the grunt work isn’t weighing them down</p>

          <h1>How can robots benefit the future?</h1>
          <p>High-quality products can lead to higher sales, which means the company that uses technology like robots is more likely to stay alive and vital, which is good for the economy. In addition to improving quality, robots improve productivity, another key element to economic health.<br><br>
          
          To think about how robots might affect future generations, consider what happened a few hundred years ago when the industrial revolution began. For instance, in 1794 Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, and later the concept of interchangeable parts for mass production of manufactured products. His inventions spurred growth in the United States, increased productivity in a variety of industries, and created more job opportunities as companies throughout the world adopted his technology and ideas.<br><br>

          In the health industry, robots are helping to research and develop drugs, package them and even assist doctors in complicated surgery such as hip replacement and open heart procedures. And the main reason robots are used in any application is because they do the work so much better that there is a vast improvement in quality and/or production, or costs are brought down so that companies can be the best at what they do while keeping workers safe.<br><br>

          Robots that work on cars and trucks are welding and assembling parts, or lifting heavy parts --the types of jobs that involve risks like injury to your back and arm or wrist, or they work in environments filled with hazards like excessive heat, noise or fumes-dangerous places for people. Robots that assemble and pack cookies or other foodstuff do so without the risk of carpal tunnel injury, unlike their human counterparts. Robots that make computer chips are working in such tiny dimensions that a person couldn't even do some of the precision work required.<br><br></p>
